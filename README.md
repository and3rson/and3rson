# Andrew Dunai

Architect, drummer, retrowave fan, freerider and simply a chill (?) guy. GMT+2. Btw, I use Arch.

- I love terminals & motorcycles.
- I love neovim, tmux, Python, & Golang.
- I love libre software. I believe majority of people underestimate its importance and are going in for some serious problems in near future.
- I love Wayland and tiling WMs (riverwm).
- I love retro computers, especially based on 6502 & Z80 CPUs. I code in 6502 assembly for fun.
- I love ESP8266.
- I love Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design.
- I hate modern internet.
- I try not to get vendor-locked.
- I love shaders & 3D graphics.
- I used to do a lot of modding for HL, CS & Dota.
- I love trebuchets because they are the superior siege weapon.
- I've spent over 9000 hours in Unreal Tournament 1999, Hitman 1-3, Half-Life (& mods), CS:GO, Hotline Miami, Dota & C&C.
- I used to be Steam & Dota 2 translator and co-organizer & broadcaster of West-Ukrainian Dota 2 tournaments.
- I used to develop cheats for CS:GO (own wallhack, modified esp hack, own flashbang hack), although I've never used them in ranked games.
- I had to deal with COBOL & DB/2 in the past. (shout-out IBM System z!)
